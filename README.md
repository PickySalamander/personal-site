# Joe's Portfolio

This is my personal website. I built this site from scratch using Angular / Typescript and hosted it on a variety of AWS services. The goal was to make a site as vanilla Angular as possible and rely mostly on the default libraries (I only ended up using the [CDK](https://material.angular.io/cdk/categories) for the mobile hamburger). I completely designed the site myself including coming up with the color scheme and logo. I hope it doesn't look too much like programmer art :-).

It is hosted from S3, through CloudFront, and using Route53 nameservers. Feel free to dive around, all code files are completely documented.
